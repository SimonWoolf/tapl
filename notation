notation

t -> t'
t evaluates to t'

t is in 'normal form':
no evaluation rule applies to it -- there is no t' such that t -> t'

->*
Multi-step evaluation (reflexive transitive closure of one-step evaluation)


nb -- a derivation tree is only for a single step t -> t'. Can be a big tree because congruence rules can nest, even though every branch bottoms out at a single axiom
